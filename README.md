> TypeScript definitions for [Defold](https://defold.com/), a high-performance cross-platform game engine.

## This Fork

This fork has more detailed types than the origin repo. My hand-written patch replaces many of the `any` keywords with specific types, sets constant values to use `const`, etc. See the changelog for details.

Can be used as a drop-in replacement of the original.

## Installation

1. Get this package from Github

```bash
yarn add git+https://git@github.com/thinknathan/ts-defold-types.git#^1.3.0 -D
# or
npm install git+https://git@github.com/thinknathan/ts-defold-types.git#^1.3.0 --save-dev
```

2. Modify your `tsconfig.json`

```diff
{
  "compilerOptions": {
+    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@ts-defold"],
+    "types": ["types"]
  }
}
```
